# arduinotemp.js
Example of an Explore board recording the current temperature every second in javascript.

To run start telegraf with the example configuration file (or telegraf with the statsd plugin) and then run node main.js. Note only tested on node 4.2.1  (Also supporting libraries don't seem to build).
