# arduinotemp.js
Example of an Explore board recording the current temperature every second in javascript.

To run start telegraf with the example configuration file (or telegraf with the statsd plugin) and load the package dependencies using 
> npm install
then run 
> node main.js . 
Note this is only tested on node 4.2.1 and supporting libraries may not build if you use a different version of node.
